ASSISI-playground is a 2-D simulator of bio-hybrid societies, developed by the ASSISIbf project. This repository contains extensions to the Enki simulator.

To find more information regarding installation, usage, and examples, consult the [readthedocs instructions](http://assisipy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), which cover installation of the python API as well as the playground simulator.

The following paper describes the design of the simulator and provides illustrations.
